### Hi there! 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Motorhome Electric technician leader. Even though I lohave anything ve this job and I used to be an embedded software for digital set-top box for a long time, I would like to be <b>a Web developer</b> for my new challenge in NZ. Please have an interest in my efforts and don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have anything with me.  
My visa is under process to be a residency. I believe that my English is still not so good yet, but if you are very generous to me, it might be not a problem on communication.
